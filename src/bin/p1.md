# project one tips 


### level one 
- First of all, we need to set the structs 
    - Bill
    - Bills with a vec of bills 

- After that, we need to implement a few functions 
    - `new` that returns an inner vec of `Self`
    - `add` that receives a mutable of `self` and does an inner push 
    - `get_all` that returns a Vec of Bill reference
        - Create an empty `bills` as Vec
        - run a for to iterate over the `self.inner` which is a `Vec` and only looks for the `values`
            - push the `bill` into the vec `bills`
        - Return the vec `bills`

- we need a function to get the user input 
    - don't forget to trim and change to a String

- we need a main menu function to show the options
    - it will contain a inner show function 
        - 1 add bill 
        - 2 vier bill 
        - enter selection
    - create a new mutable bills (use the add implementation)
    - loop to keep the code running 
        - run the show with the options
        - get the user input
        - match over the user input and cover the options
        - 1 : add bill menu 
        - 2 : view bill menu 

- Create add bill menu 
    - it needs to receive a mutable of bills 
        - get the bill name 
        - get the bill amount 
            - it requires a new function that returns a f64
               - print a message to the user askingin the amount 
                - start a loop 
                    - get the user input using the existing func
                    - parse the input as Result<f64, _>
                    - match over the input and threat the Ok and the Error
        - set a bill passing the valued we got       
        - calls the add method we created before
        - print a message that the bill was added
- Create a view bills menu function that receives a reference to Bills 
    - iterate over the bills using the function get_all
        - print the bill
    
- On main func call the main menu 


### ending level one project


### level two project 

* we need the hability to remove bills
- todo so we need to move the `Bills` struct to a hashMap instead
    - use the std collections
    - make the HashMap key as String and the `Bill` as value
- change the existing `add` function to `insert` the bill name using `clone`
- change the existing `new` function to create a HashMap instead


* we need to change the `get_all` 
- create an empty mut variable `bills` as a vec
- run a for against bills using the anotation `.values`
    - run a push passing a clone of bill
        - make sure to derive the clone for the Bill struct
- return the bills vec
- Adjust the func to not return the borrowed vec

- Create a func to remove a bill
    - it needs to receive a mutable reference of Bills
    - Show all the bills so the user can decide which one to delete
        - you can use something similar as the view bills uses
    - Get the input from the user
        - add a `remove` option for the Bills implementation
            - The func receives a mutable reference to self and a name as &str, and returns a bool
            - call the inner.remove() using the `is_some()` that returnstrue||false from the Option 
    - run a if statement using the bills calling the method `remove`
        - If true print out a message `removed`
        - if false print `bill not found`
- Add the new remove option into the main menu


### ending level two project


### level three project 
- Create a new function update_bill_menu it will be pretty similar to remove function
    - Show all the bills
    - ask for the name to update
    - get the user input

        - On the implementation of Bills create a new update function
            - This function should receive the following:
                * a mut reference of self
                * a name as borrowed string
                * amount of type f64

            - It should return a bool
        - Run a `match` against inner using the method `.get_mut()`
            cover the Arms:
            * Some bill 
                - change the bill.amount to the new amount
                - return true
            * None , just return false

    - get the amount using the func get_amount and assigning to a variable
    - run a if statement using the bills calling the method `update`
        - If true print out a message `updated`
        - if false print `bill not found`
    - Add the new `update` option into the main menu

- we need to give the user a hability to return to main menu
    - on `get_input` function change the return to be a `Option` of `String`
    - assign the buffer to a variable
    - run a if statement checking if the `&input` variable is equal to ""
        - return `None`
    - else return the `input`

- do the same as above for the `get_bill_amount`
    - return an `Option` of `f64`
    - do a if after getting the user `&input` and evaluate if its empty ""
        - if so erly return `None`
    - On the match arms change the return to Some

- Now on menu's functions we need to treat these new returns
    - for `add_bill_menu`
        - add a match expression to name returning the `input` for Some or just early `return` for `None`
        - do the same as above for `amount` 
    - for `remove_bill_menu`
        - add a match expression to name returning the `input` for Some or just early `return` for `None`
    - for `update_bill_menu`
        - add a match expression to name returning the `name` for Some or just early `return` for `None`
        - do the same as above for `amount` 
    - for `get_bill_amount`
        - we need to let `input` assign the match expression to handle Some and None
    - inside `loop` running on `main` func we also need to handle the `Options` for the user `input`
